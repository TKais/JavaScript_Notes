// A hash table is just an associative array with key/value pairs, much like a hash in Ruby. All non-scalar objects in JavaScript act like associative array (hash tables) and look like this:

var hashTable = {};

hashTable['key1'] = 1;
hashTable['key2'] = 2;
hashTable['key3'] = 3;

console.log(hashTable); // { key1: 1, key2: 2, key3: 3 }
