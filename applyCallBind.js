--APPLY, CALL & BIND --

*Functions are objects, and have methods --including bind, call and apply. 

*Apply and call are nearly identical, except apply takes an array as the second argument. They are both used for setting the 'this' value explicitly, and borrowing methods.

*Bind is used to set the 'this' value in methods.
