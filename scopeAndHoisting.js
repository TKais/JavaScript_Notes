--VARIABLE SCOPE--

*A variables scope is the context in which it exists. Its whether or not you have access to it
*JavaScript does not have block-level scope, which means variables scoped to surrounding curly brackets.
*JavaScript has function-level scope instead, where variables declared in a function are local variables and they can only be accessed within that function and by functions in that function.
