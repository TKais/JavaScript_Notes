//A binary search tree is a doubly linked list that contains some data and pointers to two nodes. A binary search tree node’s pointers are typically called “left” and “right” to indicate subtrees of values relating to the current value. A simple JavaScript implementation of such a node is as follows:


var node = {
  value: 125,
  left: null,
  right: null
}
