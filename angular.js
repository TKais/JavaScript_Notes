--ANGULAR--

A JavaScript framework that allows you to quickly develop a website by extending HTML vocabulary for dynamic views. 

1) Uses directives in the html to add angular elements, such as proper date formatting, proper currency formatting, etc.

2) Directives start with 'ng' + hyphen + whatever the directive is called. For instance, to make your app an angular app, you have to have 'ng-app = [name of app]'
  Other directives look like ng-currency and ng-controller for the controller and ng-repeat for loops.
