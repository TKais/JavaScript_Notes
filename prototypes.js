TWO MAIN CONCEPTS IN PROTOTYPES

1) Prototype Property = 
   -Every JavaScript function has it
   -Its empty by default
   -Attach properties and methods to it when you want to implement inheritence
   -Not enumerable (meaning it will not be logged out in a for/in loop)
   -Used primarily for inheritence: you add methods and properties on a functionâ€™s prototype property to make those methods and properties available to instances of that function.

   EX)

   function PrintStuff(myDocuments){
    this.documents = myDocuments;
   }

  //Add print() method to PrintStuff prototype property so that other instances (objects) can inherit it
   PrintStuff.prototype.print = function(){
    console.log(this.documents);
   }

   //create new object with PrintStuff() constructor, allowing new objects to inherit PrintStuff's properties and methods
   var newObj = new PrintStuff("This is a new document that represents myDocuments");
   newObj.print(); //This is a new document that represents myDocuments

2) Prototype Attribute = 
   -A characteristic of the object
   -Tells us the objects parent (who it inherited properties from)
   -Referred to as the 'prototype object'
   -Automatically set when you create a new object
   -Every object inherits properties from some other object
   -newObjs prototype is the PrintStuff prototype
