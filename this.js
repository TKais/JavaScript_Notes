--THIS--

*References an object (the subject in context, or the subject of the executing code)
*Think of 'this' as a pronoun that refers to a noun.

EX) 
"Tiff is running fast because she is trying to catch a plane"
'Tiff' is the object, and 'he' is the 'this'. 
ELSE
"Tiff is running fast because Tiff is trying to catch a plane"
//too redundant, we need pronouns. And we need 'this'
